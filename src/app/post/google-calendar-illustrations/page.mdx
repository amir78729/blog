# Make your Google Calendar Events Alive!

<PostMetadata metadata={metadata} />

One of the best tools for scheduling and increasing order in life is using a calendar that can be accessed at any moment. In my opinion, one of the best tools in this category is [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/), which requires nothing more than a Google account to use. Users can plan through the web, mobile, or even their smartwatch with this service, and with the help of reminder messages, they can have a more organized and beautiful life!

For someone like me who places great importance on the <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> and <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> of services they use, Google Calendar offers an attractive feature that, as far as I know, hasn't been discussed in detail and doesn't have official documentation; that is, depending on the name chosen for each event in this calendar, a graphic design appropriate to that name is selected for the event.

## How Can I See This Feature?

In the web version, just click on one of these events to see the design I'm
talking about. For mobile, in addition to selecting each event, if your calendar
is in "Schedule" mode, the relevant image will be displayed.

## How to Set Images for Google Calendar Events?

Well, I know 2 ways:
- Setting location for the Event
- Setting specific title for the Event

### Set Images by Setting Event Location

if you define a location for such events, instead of a design, the event's location will be displayed on the map or photos registered for that place in Google Maps as the event design.

In the image below, you can see an event that takes place at Milad Tower in Tehran. Google Calendar has selected this image for it using the event's location.

> At the time of writing this post, this feature is only available in the mobile version of Google Calendar.



### Set Images by Specific Event Titles

As I said, there is no official and precise documentation for which name choices
can display which designs (at least I haven't found anything at the time of
writing this post!); as a result, I've tried to list the names I've found in this
post so that you can also use this cool Google Calendar feature if you
wish.

{Object.entries(illustrationsInfo).map(([key, {title, words}]) => (
    <div key={key} >
        <LinkedHeading id={key}>
            <h3>{title}</h3>
        </LinkedHeading>

        <p>If you name your calendar event</p>

        <ul>{words.split(', ').map(w => (
            <li key={w}>{w}</li>    
        ))}</ul>

        <p>the event image will turn to:</p>

        <span id={`${key}-old`}>Old version</span>
        <Img aria-labelledby={`${key}-old`} src={`https://ssl.gstatic.com/tmly/f8944938hffheth4ew890ht4i8/flairs/xxhdpi/img_${key}.jpg`} alt={`The image will be shown on your Google Calendar event when you set event title to ${words}.`}/>


        <span id={`${key}-2024-2`}>2024 version</span>
        <Img aria-labelledby={`${key}-2024-2`} src={`https://ssl.gstatic.com/calendar/images/eventillustrations/2024_v2/img_${key}.svg`} alt={`The image will be shown on your Google Calendar event when you set event title to ${words}.`}/>

    </div>
))}
